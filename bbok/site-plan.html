      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>My purpose is to inform my audience about book banning (particularly in Oklahoma, as that is where I live) and to encourage people to read banned books. I'll have information on the history of book banning, what books have been banned, books currently banned in Oklahoma, and the importance of intellectual freedom. I may include a banned book list for reading club ideas.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>I'd say my audience is Oklahoma students, ages 12-18, but also includes young adults (and maybe older). Book banning is a topic many ages should know about, but my overall website aesthetic will be aimed at kids in middle school and high school.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        Book Banning:
        Book banning is the most widespread form of censorship in the United States, and it occurs when individuals or organizations remove books from libraries—usually school libraries—school reading lists, or bookstores because they disapprove of the content. 
        This censorship is most commonly aimed at children’s literature—young kids through teens—because these individuals/organizations fear these works will present ideas or questions among children that adults do not want to address. 
        Many of our childhood favorite novels—now considered classics—were banned at one time or another, such as “A Wrinkle in Time,” “The Wizard of Oz,” and “The Chronicles of Narnia.” At that time, people were afraid of kids reading content that depicted talking animals, magic, or women in power. 
        While these particular books are no longer in question, many authors’ voices are being censored and silenced across the nation. This site aims to inform people about banned books in the state of Oklahoma.
        Book Banning in Oklahoma Schools
        Over 500 school districts in Oklahoma have banned books since 2021. There’s 554—both public and private—school districts in the state. That’s a lot of censorship. Many students are being affected. Unfortunately, teachers are unable to voice objections to these bans; several who have were forced to resign. But that doesn’t mean you can’t choose to access these books yourself. 
        What Can You Do?:
        Educating yourself on the history of banned books—and banned books in your school/community—is a great start in countering censorship. See our other pages for book suggestions!

Where to Find These Books:
Check out your local public libraries for these titles! Your library may also have a digital database for checking out eBooks, which is another great resource for finding this titles, such as:

      <h3>Banned Book Club</h3>
      <p>
        Intellectual Freedom:
        One of the best ways we can learn and grow is through sharing ideas and experiences with one another. We expand our perspectives and develop greater empathy for others when we read other points of view than our own. 
Having access to information is a fundamental right. Censorship takes that away. Exercise your intellectual freedom through books!
Read Banned Books:
A great way to support intellectual freedom is through reading banned books. Expand your ideas. Challenge your opinions. Learn about others’ experiences. 
Reading on your own is a great start, but buddy-reading is also an option. Talk to your friends/family/community and start a book club. There are some great reads that you can discuss with one another after!
Reading Club Book List:
While there are plenty of banned books to read, and I encourage you to find what sparks an interest in you, here are a few suggestions that I think are great for book clubs:
"I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings" by Maya Angelou
"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass" by Frederick Douglass
"Looking for Alaska" by John Green
"The Outsiders" by S.E. Hinton
"Brave New World" by Aldous Huxley
"The Bluest Eye" by Toni Morrison
"Bridge to Terabithia" by Katherine Paterson 
"All American Boys" by Jason Reynolds 
"Between Shades of Gray" by Ruta Sepetys
“The Hate U Give” by Angie Thomas
Start your own banned book club!
