            <hp1>Book banning is the most widespread form of censorship in the United States, and it occurs when individuals or organizations remove books from libraries—usually school libraries—school reading lists, or bookstores because they disapprove of the content. </hp1>
            <hp2>This censorship is most commonly aimed at children’s literature—young kids through teens—because these individuals/organizations fear these works will present ideas or questions among children that adults do not want to address. </hp2>
            <hp3>Many of our childhood favorite novels—now considered classics—were banned at one time or another, such as “A Wrinkle in Time,” “The Wizard of Oz,” and “The Chronicles of Narnia.” At that time, people were afraid of kids reading content that depicted talking animals, magic, or women in power. </hp3>
            <hp4>While these particular books are no longer in question, many authors’ voices are being censored and silenced across the nation. This site aims to inform people about banned books in the state of Oklahoma. </hp4>

            <hh2>Book Banning in Oklahoma Schools</hh2>
            <hp5>Over 500 school districts in Oklahoma have banned books since 2021. There’s 554—both public and private—school districts in the state. That’s a lot of censorship. Many students are being affected. Unfortunately, teachers are unable to voice objections to these bans; several who have were forced to resign. But that doesn’t mean you can’t choose to access these books yourself. </hp5>

            <hp6>Educating yourself on the history of banned books—and banned books in your school/community—is a great start in countering censorship. See our other pages for book suggestions! </hp6>
