            <bh2>Intellectual Freedom</bh2>
            <bp1>One of the best ways we can learn and grow is through sharing ideas and experiences with one another. We expand our perspectives and develop greater empathy for others when we read other points of view than our own. </bp1>
            <bp2>Having access to information is a fundamental right. Censorship takes that away. Exercise your intellectual freedom through books! </bp2>

            <bh3>Read Banned Books</bh3>
            <bp3>A great way to support intellectual freedom is through reading banned books. Expand your ideas. Challenge your opinions. Learn about others’ experiences. </bp3>
            <bp4>Reading on your own is a great start, but buddy-reading is also an option. Talk to your friends/family/community and start a book club. There are some great reads that you can discuss with one another after! </bp4>
