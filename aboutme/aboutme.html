        <h2>Bridget Renkiewicz</h2>
        <p>Hi, everyone, I'm Bridget Renkiewicz. I currently live in Yukon, Oklahoma--just outside of Oklahoma City--though I've lived in Oklahoma since I was six years old.</p>
        <p>I love movies and film scores, and I've recently gotten into listening to podcasts. I'm a huge book lover. I tend to stick to fantasy and sci-fi, but I've recently tried to push myself to read other genres, and I also like horror and autobiographies (and the occasional contempory fiction, though I prefer magical realism).</p>
        <p>I work at my local public library, so I am pretty good at answering computer help desk questions, but that's my extent in computer knowledge. I know next to nothing about programming, so we'll see how this semester goes for me, haha.</p>
        <p>This is my last semester before graduating with my bachelor's degree in professional studies (with a focus in business and social media marketing). I signed up for this class because I needed a couple more elective credits, and I figured learning how to build a website could be beneficial in my social media marketing career goals.</p>
        <p>I wish everyone good luck this semester!</p>
